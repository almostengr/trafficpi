# Raspberry Pi Traffic Light Controller

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to educate children about the STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Through the use of low cost devices and effective 
teaching, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with 
everyday items. For example, most future engineers are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, 
but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed 
to educate future engineers about the impact that computers and computer programming has with
society. This project targets the "T, E, and M" of "STEM" by using electronic circuits 
for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and 
mathematical calculations for making timing decisions.
