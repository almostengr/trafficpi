## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to educate children about the STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Through the use of low cost devices and effective 
teaching, by grouping these subjects together, children are able to associate what they 
are learning with interactions with everyday items. For example, most children are 
aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' 
internal workings. This project is designed to educate children by explaining the 
workings of the "black box" of a traffic light. This project targets the "T, E, and 
M" of "STEM" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for 
controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making 
timing decisions.

This project is intended to be used with two traffic lights. Northbound (NB) light 
(Signal 1) has a left turn yellow and green arrows in addition to the standard 3-segment 
light. Eastbound (EB) light (Signal 2) only has a standard 3-segment light. It is possible to
only connect one traffic light assembly to the board as all code will still function.

## System Requirements
* Raspiberry Pi 3 (May work on other models, but has been tested on Raspberry Pi 3)
* Relay board(s) to handle 8 channels (optional)
* Traffic Light (actual or DIY made from LEDs)
* I2C 16x2 LCD Display 
* Breadboard Jumper Cables
* Breadboard (optional)
* Python 2.7.9 (May work with later versions, but has only be tested with 2.7.9)
* Raspbian Jessie (May work on other OSs, but has only been tested with Raspbian Jessie)
* Plastic Control Box (optional)

## Pin Setup
Below is the mapping for the connections to the Raspberry Pi. The Pin numbers
listed are the physical pin numbers on the board, not the GPIO pin numbers. If 
you are not using a relay board, the connections can be made directly to a 
breadboard with LEDs connected.

* Pi Pin (Board)		Device Pin / LED Color
* 2 --------------------- LCD Display VCC (+5V)
* 3 --------------------- LCD Display SDA
* 4 --------------------- Relay Board VCC (+5V)
* 5 --------------------- LCD Display SLC
* 19 -------------------- Signal 2 Red
* 21 -------------------- Signal 2 Yellow
* 23 -------------------- Signal 2 Green
* 29 -------------------- Signal 1 Left Turn Yellow
* 30 -------------------- LCD Display GND
* 31 -------------------- Signal 1 Left Turn Green
* 33 -------------------- Signal 1 Red
* 34 -------------------- Relay Board GND
* 35 -------------------- Signal 1 Yellow
* 37 -------------------- Signal 1 Green

## Initial Setup
In the ```scripts``` directory, run the ```script_raspitraffic.sh``` script 
as root user. This will install of the required software and python packages.

----

## Running The Scripts
To run the script, browse to the script folder, and run `python <scriptname>` 
where `<scriptname>` is the name of the script.

### Script Name and Description
* run_all_off.py - Turns off all of the lights.
* run_all_on.py - Turns on all of the lights.
* run_flasher1.py - Flashes the lights in the normal sequence, but with 
opposite colors in run_flasher2.py.
* run_flasher2.py - Flashes the lights in the normal sequence, but with 
opposite colors in run_flasher1.py.
* run_green_flash.py - Flashes all of the green lights.
* run_green_on.py - Turns on all of the green lights.
* run_guess_yellow_time_double.py - A game that requires the guess of the 
amount of time that the traffic light will show a yellow signal. This script 
is for the use of two traffic lights.
* run_guess_yellow_time_single.py - A game that requires the guess of the 
amount of time that the traffic light will show a yellow signal.  This script 
is for the use of a signal traffic light. 
* run_normal_uk.py - Operates as a normal traffic light using the UK signal phasing.
* run_normal_us.py - Operates as a normal traffic light using the US signal phasing.
* run_red_flash.py - Flashes all of the red lights.
* run_red_light_green_light.py - Operates the traffic light to play Red Light, 
Green Light game.
* run_red_on.py - Turns on all of the red lights.
* run_yellow_flash.py - Flashes all of the yellow lights.
* run_yellow_on.py - Turns on all of the yellow lights.

## Bug Reports and Road Map
Future enhancements, defects, and updates to the scripts are tracked using the 
issue tracker on this repository. For bugs, please include as much detail 
as possible so that the issue can be replicated. Special requests are 
welcome to be submitted.

----

### Known Bugs
* When exiting the script (using Ctrl+C), all of the relays may not turn off.
In addition, the LCD display may not clear if it is writing when the kill
shortcut is performed.
